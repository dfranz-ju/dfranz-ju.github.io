<p>One way to think about linear independence is to compare and contrast with the idea of spans. With spans, we are focused on which vectors we can create from the building blocks we start with (i.e. what vectors can we write as linear combinations of the starting vectors). Think of the starting vectors as types of LEGO pieces, and the Span of those vectors as containing all LEGO creations you could build with those types of pieces. The notion of linear independence addresses the question "did we need <em xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="emphasis">all</em> those starting types of LEGO pieces, or could we have started with fewer and still build everything?"</p>
