<p>Systems of linear equations are found in ancient Babylonian and Chinese texts dating back well over 2000 years. The problems are generally stated in real-life terms, but it is clear they are artificial and designed simply to train students in mathematical procedures.</p>
<p>As an example of a Babylonian problem, consider the following, which has been slightly modified from the original found on a clay tablet from about 300 BCE: There are two fields whose total area is 1800 square yards. One produces grain at a rate of \(\frac{2}{3}\) bushel per square yard, the other at a rate of \(\frac{1}{2}\) bushel per square yard. The total yield of the two fields is 1100 bushels. What is the size of each field?</p>
<p>This problem leads to the system</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{align*}
x + y \amp = 1800 \\
\frac{2}{3} x + \frac{1}{2} y \amp = 1100 
\end{align*}
</div>
<p>A typical Chinese problem, taken from the Han dynasty text <span class="booktitle">Nine Chapters of the Mathematical Art</span> (about 200 BCE), reads as follows: There are three classes of corn, of which three bundles of the first class, two of the second, and one of the third make 39 measures. Two of the first, three of the second, and one of the third make 34 measures. And one of the first, two of the second, and three of the third make 26  measures. How many measures of grain are contained in one bundle of each class?</p>
<p>The system of equations here is</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{align*}
3x+2y+z \amp =39 \\
2x + 3y + z \amp = 34\\
x + 2y + 3z \amp = 26
\end{align*}
</div>
