<p>Sage keeps track of previous cell evaluations, so we did not need to define A again in the cell above. However, we are changing A with each row operation and if we want to change our mind or try a different row operation, it can be difficult to keep track of the edits. By putting everything in the same cell, we don't have to remember invisible information (which cells were executed in which order). In your own work on CoCalc, you can just keep adding commands to the same cell as opposed to creating new cells with repeated commands.</p>
