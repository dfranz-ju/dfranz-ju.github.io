<p>A typical Chinese problem, taken from the Han dynasty text <em class="emphasis">Nine Chapters of the Mathematical Art</em> (about 200 BCE), reads as follows: There are three classes of corn, of which three bundles of the first class, two of the second, and one of the third make 39 measures. Two of the first, three of the second, and one of the third make 34 measures. And one of the first, two of the second, and three of the third make 26  measures. How many measures of grain are contained in one bundle of each class?</p>
