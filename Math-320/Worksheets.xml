		 <title>Introduction to Systems of Linear Equations</title>
		 
		 <introduction>
			 Systems of linear equations have a long history dating back thousands of years, as described in this note by Viktor Katz from the textbook Linear Algebra, 3rd ed., by Fraleigh and Beauregard:
			 
			 <p>
			 Systems of linear equations are found in ancient Babylonian and Chinese texts dating back well over 2000 years. The problems are generally stated in real-life terms, but it is clear they are artificial and designed simply to train students in mathematical procedures. 
		 </p>
		<p>	 
			 As an example of a Babylonian problem, consider the following, which has been slightly modified from the original found on a clay tablet from about 300 BCE: There are two fields whose total area is 1800 square yards. One produces grain at a rate of <m>\frac{2}{3}</m> bushel per square yard, the other at a rate of <m>\frac{1}{2}</m> bushel per square yard. The total yield of the two fields is 1100 bushels. What is the size of each field? 
		 </p>
		 <p>
			 This problem leads to the system
			 <md>
				 <mrow> x + y \amp = 1800 </mrow>
				 <mrow> \frac{2}{3} x + \frac{1}{2} y \amp = 1100 </mrow>
			 </md>
		 </p>
		 <p>
			 A typical Chinese problem, taken from the Han dynasty text <em>Nine Chapters of the Mathematical Art</em> (about 200 BCE), reads as follows: There are three classes of corn, of which three bundles of the first class, two of the second, and one of the third make 39 measures. Two of the first, three of the second, and one of the third make 34 measures. And one of the first, two of the second, and three of the third make 26  measures. How many measures of grain are contained in one bundle of each class? 
		 </p>
		 <p>
			 The system of equations here is 
			 <md>
				 <mrow> 3x+2y+z \amp =39 </mrow>
				 <mrow> 2x + 3y + z \amp = 34</mrow>
				 <mrow> x + 2y + 3z \amp = 26</mrow>
			 </md>
		 </p>
		 
		 	In this section we convert systems of linear equations into augmented matrices and use row operations to help solve the systems of linear equations.

			 <title>Solving Systems of Linear Equations</title>
			 <p>
			 	A system of linear equations has 
				<ul>
					<li>
						no solution, or
					</li>
					<li>
						exactly one solution, or
					</li>
					<li>
						infinitely many solutions.
					</li>
				</ul>
			 </p>
		 
			
			<p>
				We solve linear systems of equations by putting them into augmented matrix form and then simplifying them using one or more of the following <term>elementary row operations</term>:
				<dl>
					<li>
						<title>Replacement:</title>
						Replace one row by the sum of itself and a multiple of another row.
					</li>
				
					<li>
						<title>Interchange:</title>
						Interchange two rows.
					</li>
				
					<li>
						<title>Scaling:</title>
						Multiply all entries of a row by a nonzero constant.
					</li>
				</dl>

			<title>Using Row Operations in Sage</title>
			
			<p>
				Let's investigate how to use Sage to "simplify" augmented matrices using the three row operations.
			</p>
			
			<sage>
				<input>
					A=matrix(QQ, [[5,3,1], [1,4,-2]]); A
				</input>
			</sage>
			
			<p>
				To use the Interchange row operation, we use the <c>swap_rows</c> method. Note that Sage starts counting at 0, so the first row is row 0.
			</p>	
			
			<sage>
				<input>
					A.swap_rows(0,1); A
				</input>
				<output>
					[1 4 -2]
					[5 3 1 ]
				</output>
			</sage>
			
			<p>
				We now use a Replacement row operation; since this operation adds a multiple of one row to another row, the method name is <c>add_multiple_of_row</c>.
			</p>
			
			<sage>
				<input>
					A.add_multiple_of_row(1,0,-5); A
				</input>
			</sage>
			
			<p>
				To understand the syntax of the method <c>add_multiple_of_row</c>, read it right to left. In the above example, we added <m>-5\cdot</m> Row 0 to Row 1 (where Row 0 is the first row).
			</p>
			
			<p>
				A Scaling operation will make that second row look nicer. We use the <c>rescale_row</c> method.
			</p>
			
			<sage>
				<input>
					A.rescale_row(1, -1/17); A
				</input>
			</sage>
			
			<p>
				You should see a 4 as the top middle entry. Use a Replacement operation in the Sage cell below to change the top middle entry to a 0.
			</p>
			
			<sage>
				<input>
					
				</input>
			</sage>
