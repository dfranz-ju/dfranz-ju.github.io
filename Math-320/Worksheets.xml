		 <title>Guided Practice 1.1: Systems of Linear Equations</title>
		 
		 <introduction>
			 <title>Overview</title>
			 <p>
			 In this section, we begin our study of linear systems of equations, one of the main topics of Linear Algebra. The section starts by collecting some basic terminology and presenting a geometric context for linear systems to help understand their possible solutions. We then introduce matrix notation for linear systems and show its usefulness in solving linear systems with an example which motivates the definition of the <term>elementary row operations</term>. The section concludes with a discussion of <em>consistency</em> and <em>solution uniqueness</em> for linear systems. 
		 </p>
			 
		 <p>
			 <alert>Historical Note:</alert> Systems of linear equations have a long history dating back thousands of years, as described in this note by Viktor Katz from the textbook Linear Algebra, 3rd ed., by Fraleigh and Beauregard:
			 
			 <blockquote>
			 <p>
			 Systems of linear equations are found in ancient Babylonian and Chinese texts dating back well over 2000 years. The problems are generally stated in real-life terms, but it is clear they are artificial and designed simply to train students in mathematical procedures. 
		 </p>
		<p>	 
			 As an example of a Babylonian problem, consider the following, which has been slightly modified from the original found on a clay tablet from about 300 BCE: There are two fields whose total area is 1800 square yards. One produces grain at a rate of <m>\frac{2}{3}</m> bushel per square yard, the other at a rate of <m>\frac{1}{2}</m> bushel per square yard. The total yield of the two fields is 1100 bushels. What is the size of each field? 
		 </p>
		 <p>
			 This problem leads to the system
			 <md>
				 <mrow> x + y \amp = 1800 </mrow>
				 <mrow> \frac{2}{3} x + \frac{1}{2} y \amp = 1100 </mrow>
			 </md>
		 </p>
		 <p>
			 A typical Chinese problem, taken from the Han dynasty text <pubtitle>Nine Chapters of the Mathematical Art</pubtitle> (about 200 BCE), reads as follows: There are three classes of corn, of which three bundles of the first class, two of the second, and one of the third make 39 measures. Two of the first, three of the second, and one of the third make 34 measures. And one of the first, two of the second, and three of the third make 26  measures. How many measures of grain are contained in one bundle of each class? 
		 </p>
		 <p>
			 The system of equations here is 
			 <md>
				 <mrow> 3x+2y+z \amp =39 </mrow>
				 <mrow> 2x + 3y + z \amp = 34</mrow>
				 <mrow> x + 2y + 3z \amp = 26</mrow>
			 </md>

			 <title>Sage Commands</title>

 			<p>
 				The elementary row operations can be easily applied using Sage. First, we create a matrix that we can apply row operations to using the <c>matrix</c> command. The <c>QQ</c> is telling Sage to treat the entries of the matrix as rational numbers, so that we may divide later. (Evaluate the cell below)
 			</p>
			
 			<sage>
 				<input>
 					A=matrix(QQ, [[5,3,1], [1,4,-2]]); #creates a matrix and names it A
					A #prints the matrix named A
 				</input>
 			</sage>

			
 			<p>
 				To use the <term>Interchange</term> row operation, we use the <c>swap_rows</c> method. Note that Sage always starts counting at 0, so the first row is row 0.
 			</p>	
			
 			<sage>
 				<input>
					A=matrix(QQ, [[5,3,1], [1,4,-2]]);
					A.swap_rows(0,1); #swaps row 0 and row 1
					A
 				</input>
 				<output>
 					[1 4 -2]
 					[5 3 1 ]
 				</output>
 			</sage>
			
			<p>
				Sage keeps track of previous cell evaluations, so we did not need to define A again in the cell above. However, we are changing A with each row operation and if we want to change our mind or try a different row operation, it can be difficult to keep track of the edits. By putting everything in the same cell, we don't have to remember invisible information (which cells were executed in which order). In your own work on CoCalc, you can just keep adding commands to the same cell as opposed to creating new cells with repeated commands.
			</p>
			
 			<p>
 				We now use a <term>Replacement</term> row operation; since this operation adds a multiple of one row to another row, the method name is <c>add_multiple_of_row</c>.
 			</p>
			
 			<sage>
 				<input>
					A=matrix(QQ, [[5,3,1], [1,4,-2]]);
					A.swap_rows(0,1);
					A.add_multiple_of_row(1,0,-5); #adds -5*row 0 to row 1
					A
 				</input>
 			</sage>
			
 			<p>
 				To understand the syntax of the method <c>add_multiple_of_row</c>, read it right to left. In the above example, we added <m>-5\cdot</m> Row 0 to Row 1 (where Row 0 is the first row).
 			</p>
			
 			<p>
 				A <term>Scaling</term> operation will make that second row look nicer. We use the <c>rescale_row</c> method.
 			</p>
			
 			<sage>
 				<input>
					A=matrix(QQ, [[5,3,1], [1,4,-2]]);
					A.swap_rows(0,1);
					A.add_multiple_of_row(1,0,-5);
					A.rescale_row(1, -1/17); #multiplies row 1 by -1/17
					A
 				</input>
 			</sage>
			
 			<p>
 				You should see a 4 as the top middle entry. Try using a Replacement operation in the Sage cell below to change the top middle entry to a 0. (Feel free to use copy and paste!)
 			</p>

		 <title>Guided Practice 1.2: Row Reduction and Echelon Forms</title>
		 
		 <introduction>
			 <title>Overview</title>
			 <p>
			 This section continues the study of systems of linear equations and their solutions. We refine the methods from Section 1.1 of solving linear systems by introducting the notions of <em>echelon form</em> and <em>reduced echelon form</em> of a matrix. When an augmented matrix is in echelon form, questions about consistency and uniqueness of solutions can be easily answered. When an augmented matrix is in reduced echelon form, we can easliy solve the system (if it is consistent).
		 </p>
			 
		 <p>
			 Examples 2 and 3 illustrate the <em>Row Reduction Algorithm</em>, which we use to reduce a matrix to echelon or reduced echelon form. The section continues by showing how to use reduced echelon form to solve linear systems. Many of the problems and concepts the rest of the semester will involve reducing matrices to echelon or reduced echelon form and analyzing the result; while we will eventually use a single Sage command to accomplish the computational side, we will be interpreting reduced echelon form matrices in different contexts the remainder of the semester.

				 <em>Reading</em>: Read Section 1.2 of the textbook, keeping the learning objectives in mind. It's helpful to write down new vocabulary words and notation along with short definitions/examples and to actively work along with the examples on your own paper. Example 3 is the main example of applying the row reduction algorithm. The section ends with a general strategy for solving linear systems.
			 </p>
			 
			 <p>
				 <em>Video</em>: The video below, recorded by me, demonstrates the process of row reducing a matrix into reduced echelon form using Sage commands in CoCalc. I recommend watching it after reading Example 3 in the textbook, then read Example 3 again.

 			<p>
 				The <c>rref</c> method outputs the reduced echelon form of the matrix it is applied to. Note that by Theorem 1 of this section, each matrix has a <em>unique</em> reduced echelon form. This makes this an excellent tool for checking your work, as you can immeditely tell by inspection if you have reduced a matrix correctly. 
			</p>
				
			<p>
				For now, I expect you to continue using elementary row operations when row reducing, using <c>rref</c> only to check your work. Later in the semester, you will be allowed to use <c>rref</c> whenever a problem requires you to row reduce a matrix.
				
			</p>	
				
			<p>
				A couple of examples below show the <c>rref</c> method in action.
			</p>
 			
			
			
			
 			<sage>
 				<input>
 					A=matrix(QQ, [[5,3,1], [1,4,-2]]); #creates a matrix and names it A
					print(A) #prints the matrix named A
					A.rref() #computes the reduced echelon form of A
 				</input>
 			</sage>
			
			Displaying multiple matrices can look messy with the default output. The <c>show</c> command formats the output in a more pleasing fashion:
 			<sage>
 				<input>
 					A=matrix(QQ, [[5,3,1], [1,4,-2]]);
					show(A) #displays the matrix named A, formatted
					show(A.rref())
 				</input>
 			</sage>
			
			
			
 			<p>
 				Note that while applying row operations in Sage changes the matrix being acted on, so that <m>A</m> would eventually be a matrix in reduced echelon form, the <c>rref</c> method creates a <em>new</em> matrix, which is in reduced echelon form and row equivalent to the original matrix, as illustrated below, where we see that the original matrix <m>B</m> is unchanged when its reduced echelon form is computed using <c>rref</c>.
 			</p>	
			
 			<sage>
 				<input>
					B=matrix(3,4, [[5,3,1,4], [1,4,-2,3], [0,3,2,6]]);
					C=B.rref();
					show(B);
					show(C)

		 <title>Guided Practice 1.3: Vector Equations</title>
		 
		 <introduction>
			 <title>Overview</title>
			 <p>
				 In Section 1.1, we introduced a new mathematical object, matrices, to help study linear systems of equations. In this section, we introduce <em>vectors</em>, another possibly more familiar mathematical object that will aid us. 
		 </p>
			
		 <p>
			 After describing vectors and their basic properties both algebraically and geometrically, the section begins relating them back to linear systems by introducing the very important concepts of <em>linear combinations</em> and <em>spans</em>. These two highly related concepts will be used repeatedly throughout the rest of the semester. Example 5 and the following discussion illustrate the strong connection between questions about linear combinations and questions about linear systems. The geometric descriptions should be used to help build intuition about these new concepts.

The vectors <m>c\mathbf{u}</m> and <m>d\mathbf{v}</m> are shown in blue, while the linear combination <m>c\mathbf{u} + d\mathbf{v}</m> is shown in purple. You can use the sliders for <m>c</m> and <m>d</m> to adjust their values and see how the linear combination changes. You can hit the play symbol on each slider or manually drag the slider to change the value.

			 <title>Sage Commands</title>

 			<p>
 				When written as column vectors, vectors behave like <m>n \times 1</m> matrices, and they can be coded as such in Sage. As a shortcut, you can specify the number of rows (number of entries in the vector) and then include a single list of the entries.
			</p>
 			<sage>
 				<input>
 					u=matrix(3, [2,4,6]);
					v=matrix(5, [1,3,5,7,9]);
					show(u);
					show(v)
 				</input>
 			</sage>
			
			
				
			<p>
				However, we often want to treat vectors as vectors specifically. In Sage, we use the <c>vector</c> command, which is similar to the <c>matrix</c> command. We do not need to state the number of entries with this command; we simply list them out. Note also that Sage displays the result in row form (an alternative display form discussed in the textbook), but they are treated the same as column vectors.
				</p>
	 			<sage>
	 				<input>
	 					u=vector([2,4,6]);
						v=vector([1,3,5,7,9]);
						show(u);
						show(v);
						v
	 				</input>
	 			</sage>
				
				
			<p>
				The cell below demonstrates how to create linear combinations of vectors. Note that writing "5v1" will cause an error; a multiplication symbol is needed between the scalar and the vector.
			</p>
 			
 			<sage>
 				<input>
 					v1=vector([1,-3,4]);
					v2=vector([2,5,1]);
					print(v1+v2);
					print(v1-v2);
					print(5*v1);
					print(3*v1+7*v2);
					print(-3*v1-4*v2)
 				</input>
 			</sage>
			
			One nice consequence of Sage vectors is that we can easily create matrices out of them. We will usually want to create matrices whose columns are some given vectors. This is done using the <c>column_matrix</c> command and demonstrated below.
 			<sage>
 				<input>
 					u1=vector([1,2,3]);
					u2=vector([4,5,6]);
					u3=vector([7,8,9]);
					A=column_matrix([u1,u2,u3]);
					show(A)

		 <title>Guided Practice 1.4: The Matrix Equation <m>A\mathbf{x}=\mathbf{b}</m></title>
		 
		 <introduction>
			 <title>Overview</title>
			 <p>
				 In Section 1.3, we saw that we could reframe a system of linear equations as a single vector equation, in which one side was a linear combination of vectors. In this section, we continue to reframe systems of equations, this time by replacing a linear combination of vectors by a product of a matrix and a vector (see the definition on page 35). This creates a <em>matrix equation</em> which is equivalent to the vector equation and system of linear equations.
		 </p>
			
		 <p>
			 A major benefit of using matrix equations is that it helps us more easily analyze properties of linear systems. The discussion of this in the textbook culminates in Theorem 4, which relates consistency, linear combinations, spans, and pivot positions of a relevant matrix. This theorem is one of our main tools in answering problems and translating between different interpretations and perspectives. 
		 </p>
			
		<p>
			The remainder of the section focuses on properties of matrix-vector multiplication. Even though we will be doing most of our multiplication with technology, it is important to be able to do small matrix-vector computations by hand, so certainly read pages 38-39 and practice the "row-vector" rule. The top of page 39 also introduces the <em>identity matrix</em>, an important kind of matrix we will be seeing again.

 			<p>
 				Sage naturally understands multiplication of a vector by a matrix using the usual multiplication symbol (shift+8 on most keyboards). (Remember that Sage displays vectors in row form with parentheses, but correctly treats them as column vectors)
			</p>
 			<sage>
 				<input>
 					A=matrix([[1,2,3], [4,5,6], [7,8,9]]);
					B=matrix([[1,3,5], [7,8,9]]);
					v=vector([-1,3,-5]);
					show("A=",A," B=",B," v=",v)
					show("Av=",A*v)
					show("Bv=",B*v)
 				</input>
 			</sage>
			
			<p>
				Note that the dimensions have to match up (the number of columns of the matrix should match the number of entries in the vector); if they do not, then Sage will output an error (which you can see by executing the code below).
			</p>
			
 			<sage>
 				<input>
 					C=matrix([[1,2],[3,4], [5,6]])
					show("C=",C)
					v=vector([-1,3,-5]);
					show("v=",v)
					C*v
 				</input>
 			</sage>
			
				
			
			As a reminder, if vectors are already defined, you can create a matrix using them. To make a matrix with the vectors as columns, use the <c>column_matrix</c> command, shown below. To make a matrix with the vectors as rows, just use the <c>matrix</c> command with the vectors given inside brackets.
 			<sage>
 				<input>
 					u1=vector([1,2,3]);
					u2=vector([4,5,6]);

		 <title>Guided Practice 1.5: Solution Sets of Linear Systems</title>
		 
		 <introduction>
			 <title>Overview</title>
			 <p>
				 In the previous sections, we have studied systems of linear equations in many forms, using augmented matrices, vector equations, and matrix equations. In this section we delve deeper into how we describe the solution sets of linear systems, specifically in the case of infinitely many solutions (it is pretty easy to describe no solutions or 1 solution). This is accomplished using vector notation, which also opens up geometric descriptions of solution sets.
		 </p>
			
		 <p>
			 The section begins by examining <em>homogeneous</em> linear systems, lineasr systems whose matrix equations are of the form $A\mathbf{x}=\mathbf{0}$. These are easier to study and, surpisingly, an understanding of the solution sets of homogeneous systems is all we need to understand solution sets of <em>all</em> linear systems, as is made clear in Theorem 6.
