		 <title>Guided Practice: Systems of Linear Equations</title>
		 
		 <introduction>
			 <title>Overview</title>
			 <p>
			 In this section, we begin our study of linear systems of equations, one of the main topics of Linear Algebra. The section starts by collecting some basic terminology and presenting a geometric context for linear systems to help understand their possible solutions. We then introduce matrix notation for linear systems and show its usefulness in solving linear systems with an example which motivates the definition of the <term>elementary row operations</term>. The section concludes with a discussion of <em>consistency</em> and <em>solution uniqueness</em> for linear systems. 
		 </p>
			 
		 <p>
			 <alert>Historical Note:</alert> Systems of linear equations have a long history dating back thousands of years, as described in this note by Viktor Katz from the textbook Linear Algebra, 3rd ed., by Fraleigh and Beauregard:
			 
			 <blockquote>
			 <p>
			 Systems of linear equations are found in ancient Babylonian and Chinese texts dating back well over 2000 years. The problems are generally stated in real-life terms, but it is clear they are artificial and designed simply to train students in mathematical procedures. 
		 </p>
		<p>	 
			 As an example of a Babylonian problem, consider the following, which has been slightly modified from the original found on a clay tablet from about 300 BCE: There are two fields whose total area is 1800 square yards. One produces grain at a rate of <m>\frac{2}{3}</m> bushel per square yard, the other at a rate of <m>\frac{1}{2}</m> bushel per square yard. The total yield of the two fields is 1100 bushels. What is the size of each field? 
		 </p>
		 <p>
			 This problem leads to the system
			 <md>
				 <mrow> x + y \amp = 1800 </mrow>
				 <mrow> \frac{2}{3} x + \frac{1}{2} y \amp = 1100 </mrow>
			 </md>
		 </p>
		 <p>
			 A typical Chinese problem, taken from the Han dynasty text <pubtitle>Nine Chapters of the Mathematical Art</pubtitle> (about 200 BCE), reads as follows: There are three classes of corn, of which three bundles of the first class, two of the second, and one of the third make 39 measures. Two of the first, three of the second, and one of the third make 34 measures. And one of the first, two of the second, and three of the third make 26  measures. How many measures of grain are contained in one bundle of each class? 
		 </p>
		 <p>
			 The system of equations here is 
			 <md>
				 <mrow> 3x+2y+z \amp =39 </mrow>
				 <mrow> 2x + 3y + z \amp = 34</mrow>
				 <mrow> x + 2y + 3z \amp = 26</mrow>
			 </md>

			 <title>Basic Learning Objectives </title>
		<p>
			 You should be able to perform these tasks with reasonable fluency <em>when you arrive to class</em>.
			 
			 <ul>
				 <li>
				 	Describe the possible solution sets of a linear system of equations.
				 </li>
				 <li>
				 	Translate a linear system into its corresponding coefficient and augmented matrices.
				 </li>
				 <li>
				 	Translate an augmented matrix into a linear system.
				 </li>
				 <li>
				 	Apply elementary row operations to matrices.
				 </li>
			 </ul>
			
		 </p>
		 </subsection>
		 
		 <subsection xml:id="subsection-1-1-ALO">
			 <title>Advanced Learning Objectives </title>
		<p>
			In addition to mastering the basic objectives, here are the tasks you should be able to perform <em>after class, with practice</em>:
			 
			 <ul>
				 <li>
				 	Use elementary row operations to determine if a linear system is consistent.
				 </li>
				 <li>
				 	Solve linear systems that have unique solutions using elementary row operations.
				 </li>
			 </ul>

			 <title>Resources</title>
			 <p>
				 <em>Reading</em>: Read Section 1.1 of the textbook, keeping the learning objectives in mind. It's helpful to write down new vocabulary words and notation along with short definitions/examples and to actively work along with the examples on your own paper.
			 </p>
			 
			 <p>
				 <em>Video</em>: TBD

		 <subsection xml:id="subsection-1-1-Sage">
			 <title>Sage Commands</title>

 			<p>
 				The elementary row operations can be easily applied using Sage. First, we create a matrix that we can apply row operations to using the <c>matrix</c> command. The <c>QQ</c> is telling Sage to treat the entries of the matrix as rational numbers, so that we may divide later. (Evaluate the cell below)
 			</p>
			
 			<sage>
 				<input>
 					A=matrix(QQ, [[5,3,1], [1,4,-2]]); #creates a matrix and names it A
					A #prints the matrix named A
 				</input>
 			</sage>
			
 			<p>
 				To use the <term>Interchange</term> row operation, we use the <c>swap_rows</c> method. Note that Sage always starts counting at 0, so the first row is row 0.
 			</p>	
			
 			<sage>
 				<input>
					A=matrix(QQ, [[5,3,1], [1,4,-2]]);
					A.swap_rows(0,1); #swaps row 0 and row 1
					A
 				</input>
 				<output>
 					[1 4 -2]
 					[5 3 1 ]
 				</output>
 			</sage>
			
			<p>
				Sage keeps track of previous cell evaluations, so we did not need to define A again in the cell above. However, we are changing A with each row operation and if we want to change our mind or try a different row operation, it can be difficult to keep track of the edits. By putting everything in the same cell, we don't have to remember invisible information (which cells were executed in which order). In your own work on CoCalc, you can just keep adding commands to the same cell as opposed to creating new cells with repeated commands.
			</p>
			
 			<p>
 				We now use a <term>Replacement</term> row operation; since this operation adds a multiple of one row to another row, the method name is <c>add_multiple_of_row</c>.
 			</p>
			
 			<sage>
 				<input>
					A=matrix(QQ, [[5,3,1], [1,4,-2]]);
					A.swap_rows(0,1);
					A.add_multiple_of_row(1,0,-5); #adds -5*row 0 to row 1
					A
 				</input>
 			</sage>
			
 			<p>
 				To understand the syntax of the method <c>add_multiple_of_row</c>, read it right to left. In the above example, we added <m>-5\cdot</m> Row 0 to Row 1 (where Row 0 is the first row).
 			</p>
			
 			<p>
 				A <term>Scaling</term> operation will make that second row look nicer. We use the <c>rescale_row</c> method.
 			</p>
			
 			<sage>
 				<input>
					A=matrix(QQ, [[5,3,1], [1,4,-2]]);
					A.swap_rows(0,1);
					A.add_multiple_of_row(1,0,-5);
					A.rescale_row(1, -1/17); #multiplies row 1 by -1/17
					A
 				</input>
 			</sage>
			
 			<p>
 				You should see a 4 as the top middle entry. Try using a Replacement operation in the Sage cell below to change the top middle entry to a 0. (Feel free to use copy and paste!)
 			</p>
