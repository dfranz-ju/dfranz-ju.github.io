<p>Students who did very well in a Pre-Calculus course in high school (or took a Calculus class but didn’t earn AP credit) may be prepared to take MATH 140: Calculus I at JU.  To be successful, those students will want to be comfortable with the following skills:</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li>Understand function notation and the relationship between a function’s formula and graph;</li>
<li>Understand the relationship between composition and inverse;</li>
<li>Know the rules for manipulating exponents;</li>
<li>Factor quadratic expressions;</li>
<li>Have skill at solving equations for a variable;</li>
<li>Understand the relationship between a function’s formula and graph;</li>
<li>Recognize the graphs of polynomial, exponential, logarithmic, and trigonometric functions;</li>
<li>Be able to recognize asymptotes and removable discontinuities in rational functions;</li>
<li>Be comfortable working with sin(x), cos(x), and tan(x);</li>
<li>Have expertise working with linear functions both graphically and algebraically;</li>
<li>Understand exponential growth and decay;</li>
<li>Pick out the main ideas in word problems and understand real-world applications including the correct use of units.</li>
</ul>
<p class="continuation">As a guide to helping understand whether they have these skills, students entering MATH 140 should be able to successfully complete the problems listed here: <a href="math-140.html" class="internal" title="Section 1: Math 140 Problems">Math 140 Problems</a>.</p>
