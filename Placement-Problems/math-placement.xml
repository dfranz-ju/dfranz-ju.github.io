 <title>Mathematics Placement at JU</title>
 <introduction>
  <p>
	  This information will help you decide which Math class you’re prepared to take at JU.  (Different majors require different courses, so you’ll want to consult with your advisor and/or the catalog to see what you’ll eventually need to take.  This page helps you figure out where you’re ready to enter the math curriculum at JU.)  There are 4 different levels you could start at; use the information below to decide which is right for you.
  </p> 


  
  <p>
	  <alert> MATH 140: Caclulus 1</alert>
  </p>
  <p>
  	Students who did very well in a Pre-Calculus course in high school (or took a Calculus class but didn’t earn AP credit) may be prepared to take MATH 140: Calculus I at JU.  To be successful, those students will want to be comfortable with the following skills:
	
	<ul>
		<li>
			Understand function notation and the relationship between a function’s formula and graph;
		</li>
		
		<li>
			Understand the relationship between composition and inverse;
		</li>
		
		<li>
			Know the rules for manipulating exponents;
		</li>
		
		<li>
			Factor quadratic expressions;
		</li>
		
		<li>
			Have skill at solving equations for a variable;
		</li>
		
		<li>
			Understand the relationship between a function’s formula and graph;
		</li>
		
		<li>
			Recognize the graphs of polynomial, exponential, logarithmic, and trigonometric functions;
		</li>
		
		<li>
			Be able to recognize asymptotes and removable discontinuities in rational functions;
		</li>
		
		<li>
			Be comfortable working with sin(x), cos(x), and tan(x);
		</li>
		
		<li>
			Have expertise working with linear functions both graphically and algebraically;
		</li>
		
		<li>
			Understand exponential growth and decay;
		</li>
		
		<li>
			Pick out the main ideas in word problems and understand real-world applications including the correct use of units.
		</li>
	</ul>

	As a guide to helping understand whether they have these skills, students entering MATH 140 should be able to successfully complete the problems listed here: <xref ref="math-140" text="custom">Math 140 Problems</xref>. 
  </p>
  
  
  <p>
	  <alert>Core-Level Math Classes </alert>
  </p>
  
  <p>
  	Not everyone needs to take Calculus!  Students are typically prepared to take Core-Level Math Classes (MATH 110, MATH 112, MATH 114, MATH 205) at JU if they did well in their high school math classes, particularly if those classes included a Pre-Calculus class.  To be successful, those students want to be comfortable with the following skills:

  
  <ul>
	  <li>
	  	Use operations including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division in the appropriate order;
	  </li>
	  
	  <li>
	  	Be able to add fractions;
	  </li>
	  
	  <li>
	  	Be able to factor quadratic expressions;
	  </li>
	  
	  <li>
	  	Solving linear equations and inequalities;
	  </li>
	  
	  <li>
	  	Manipulating exponents and radicals (or roots);
	  </li>
	  
	  <li>
	  	Use basic strategies for solving equations for a variable;
	  </li>
	  
	  <li>
	  	Have a general understanding of function and function notation;
	  </li>
	  
	  <li>
	  	Be able to add, subtract, and multiply polynomials;
	  </li>
	  
	  <li>
	  	Understand ratios, percentages (how to calculate a percent), proportions and how they are related;
	  </li>
	  
	  <li>
	  	Pick out the main ideas in word problems.
	  </li>
  </ul>
  </p>
  
  <p>
  	  As a guide to helping understand whether they have these skills, students entering Core-Level Math Classes should be able to successfully complete the problems listed here: <xref text="custom" ref="math-110">Core-Level Problems</xref>.
  </p>



  
  <p>
	  <alert>MATH 104: College Algebra</alert>
  </p>
  
  <p>
  	Some students need some extra preparation before they’re ready for Core-Level Math Classes.  Most of those students will want to take MATH 104: College Algebra.  Students are ready for MATH 104 if they are comfortable with the following skills:
	
	<ul>
		<li>
			Perform basic mathematical operations in the correct order;
		</li>
		
		<li>
			Be able to work with integers and rational numbers;
		</li>
		
		<li>
			Understand the idea of constants, variables, and exponents;
		</li>
		
		<li>
			Have a general understanding of how to manipulate equations;
		</li>
		
		<li>
			Solve basic linear equations and inequalities;
		</li>
		
		<li>
			Understand graphs (including linear graphs) and the Cartesian coordinate system;
		</li>
		
		<li>
			Understand ratios, percentages, and proportions and how they are related.
		</li>
		
	</ul>
	
	As a guide to helping understand whether they have these skills, students entering MATH 104 should be able to successfully complete the problems listed here:  <xref text="custom" ref="math-104">Math 104 Problems</xref>.
  </p>
  
  
  <p>
	  <alert>MATH 100: Basic College Mathematics </alert>
  </p>
  
  <p>
	  Students who don’t feel they’d be successful in MATH 104 should start in MATH 100: Basic College Mathematics instead.  
  </p>
  <p>
	  If you’re still not sure which math class is right for you, consult with your advisor or reach out to the mathematics department.

	   <exercise>
		   <statement>
			   <p>
				  Let <m>f(x)=\dfrac{x^3-9x}{2x^3-6x^2}</m>.
				  
				  <ol>
					  <li>
						  Identify the locations of the discontinuities of <m>f(x)</m> and classify them as holes or the location of a vertical asymptote.
					  </li>
					  
					  <li>
						  Analyze the end behavior of <m>f</m>. That is, what happens as <m>x</m> goes towards <m>\infty</m> or <m>-\infty</m>?
					  </li>
				  </ol>
			   </p>
			   
			  
			   

		   </statement>
		   
		   <solution>
			   <p>
				   <ol>
					   <li>
						   <p>
							   First factor the denominator of <m>f(x)</m>:
							   <me>2x^3-6x^2=2x^2(x-3)</me>.
							   The denominator equals <m>0</m> when <m>x=0</m> or <m>x=3</m>, so those are the locations of the discontinuities.
						   </p>
						   
						   <p>
							   To classify them, we factor the numerator as well and cancel where possible:
							   <me>x^3-9x=x(x^2-9)=x(x-3)(x+3)</me>.
							   So
							   <me>\frac{x(x-3)(x+3)}{2x^2(x-3)}=\frac{x+3}{2x}</me>.
							   Since <m>x-3</m> is no longer in the denominator after canceling, <m>x=3</m> is a hole in the graph. Since <m>x</m> is still in the denominator, <m>x=0</m> is a vertical asymptote of the graph.
						   </p>
						   
					   </li>
					   
					   <li>
						   In the long run, <m>f</m> behaves like <m>y=\dfrac{x^3}{2x^3}=\dfrac{1}{2}</m>. That is, the graph has a horizontal asymptote of <m>y=\frac{1}{2}</m> to both the left and right.

					   <li>
						   The slope is found by computing rise over run using the given points:

							   \text{slope} = \frac{2744-2636}{4-1} = \frac{108}{3} = 36
						   </me>.
					   </li>
					   
					   <li>
						   The year <m>2000</m> corresponds to <m>t=0</m>, so we want the <m>S</m>-intercept of the line, which is <m>2600</m> students.
					   </li>
					   
					   <li>
						   We know the slope and intercept of the line, so we use slope-intercept form:
